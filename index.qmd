**I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I apply my passion for science and learning to both research and teaching.**

##### Research

My research focuses on herding dogs that work with farmers to manage livestock. I use cognitive and behavioral approaches to learn about herding dogs and the humans that work with them. I aim to use scientific methods to inform herding dog practices, with the ultimate goal of improving the effectiveness of herding dogs at their job. Currently, I pursue this line of research as a member of the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu/) at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

##### Teaching

As a teacher, I aim to empower my students to take ownership of their learning. My passion for science drives me to root my teaching in evidence-based methods. My experience as a student at nontraditional schools like [Touchstone Community School](https://www.touchstoneschool.com/) (K-8) and [Hampshire College](https://www.hampshire.edu/) (undergraduate) inspires me to question traditional teaching practices.
