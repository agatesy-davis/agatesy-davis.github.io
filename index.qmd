I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 

<!-- #### Research -->

<!-- My research focuses on herding dogs that work with farmers to manage livestock. I use cognitive and behavioral approaches to learn about herding dogs and the humans that work with them. I aim to use scientific methods to inform herding dog practices, with the ultimate goal of improving the effectiveness of herding dogs at their job. Currently, I pursue this line of research as a member of the [Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab](https://dogcog.unl.edu/) at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. -->

<!-- #### Teaching -->

<!-- Someting about evidence-based teaching and sharing my love of science with students. Inspired by nontraditional educaiton in my past. -->
