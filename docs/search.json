    "text": "I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I apply my passion for science and learning to both research and teaching.\n\nResearch\nMy research focuses on herding dogs that work with farmers to manage livestock. I use cognitive and behavioral approaches to learn about herding dogs and the humans that work with them. I aim to use scientific methods to inform herding dog practices, with the ultimate goal of improving the effectiveness of herding dogs at their job. Currently, I pursue this line of research as a member of the Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\n\nTeaching\nAs a teacher, I aim to empower my students to take ownership of their learning. My passion for science drives me to root my teaching in evidence-based methods. My experience as a student at nontraditional schools like Touchstone Community School (K-8) and Hampshire College (undergraduate) inspires me to question traditional teaching practices."
